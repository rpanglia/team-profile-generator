# The Team-Profile Generator

## Description
The Team-Profile Generator is a command-line application that allows users to input information about their employees to generate an HTML wepage displaying summaries of all team members. This application was created for a Software Engineering Team and in this case collects information on Managers, Engineers and Interns. Summaries of each team member are displayed in cards with clickable links to send employees emails or visit their GitHub pages, where appropriate.

This application runs in node.js and utilizes the NPM Jest and Inquirer Packages.
